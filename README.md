# Interactive Whiskey API
I love Whiskey, and I love keeping track of different ones that I have tried. This is a way for anyone to add and delete whiskeys that they like or have tried. Though it is spelled eith an "E", it is not exclusionary to only whisk(e)ys. 

**Link to project:** Check back soon for a link to the hosted site.


## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB

Using the CRUD principles, I created this API to track different whiskeys by their name, maker and a short description. The API can update with new information after the user inputs the details. If the user wants to delete the input, they can by clicking on the trashcan icon. The idea of this API is to make documenting of whiskeys very easy and open sourced.

## Optimizations
In the future, I would like to come back to this to make it more organized after entry. Having the whiskeys organized alphabetically by the makers name would make searching for them easier. I might add likes as well, so that users can give input on great whiskeys and an ability to sort by the likes.
